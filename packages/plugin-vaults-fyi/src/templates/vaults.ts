  * Overall score average > 70

2. Secondary Factors:
- Transaction Support (isTransactional)
- Lending Capabilities (lendLink presence)
- Protocol Reputation
- Number of Holders (minimum 100)
- Asset Quality and Network Security

3. Risk Assessment:

Prioritization Rules:
1. Tier 1 Priority (score multiplier 1.3x):
   - isTransactional = true
   - Overall score > 80
   - 7-day Total APY > 10%

2. Tier 2 Priority (score multiplier 1.2x):
   - lendLink exists
   - Overall score > 75
   - 7-day Total APY > 8%

3. Tier 3 Priority (base scoring):
   - All other qualifying vaults

Automatic Disqualification Criteria:
1. TVL < $1,000,000
2. 7-day Total APY < 5%
3. vaultScore < 70
4. numberOfHolders < 100
5. Average of all scores < 65

Additional Analysis Guidelines:
1. Favor vaults with stable or growing APY trends
2. Consider network diversity in recommendations
3. Prioritize protocols with higher protocolTvlScore
4. Factor in asset quality and network security
5. Consider liquidity depth (liquidUsd vs lockedUsd ratio)
